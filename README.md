This is a modern web3.0 Blockchain app that allows you to send Ethererum from your wallet to another wallet. It also adds GIFs to every transfet to have that seamless, interactive feel.
## How to use
Change your current directory to the client directory and type in the command 'npm run dev'. This is different from your typiacl React command because I used Vite, which is much faster, as you can probably tell.
